## Call for papers

We solicit submissions that in the broad sense focus on achieving data efficiency through incorporating prior knowledge of the visual domain into network design. This includes the following topics:

- Pre-wired invariance/equivariance to symmetries, such as translation, rotation, scaling, etc.
- Parameter sharing for data efficiency
- (Meta-)learning symmetries from data
- Unsupervised learning through visual priors, e.g. contrastive learning
- Color invariants/constants in Deep Learning
- Data augmentation
- Human vision as an inspiration for data-efficient vision algorithms, e.g. reducing texture bias in Convolutional Neural Networks, modeling network operations after human vision, etc.
- Alternative data-efficient operators for Deep Learning inspired by visual inductive priors, e.g. alternative compact filter bases, Capsule Networks, etc.

Please note that this list is not exhaustive! We strongly encourage novel approaches to data efficient methods using visual prior knowledge.

## Submissions

Submissions are sollicited through OpenReview. Reviewing will be double-blind. We do not have a discussion/rebuttal period. The top accepted papers will be invited to orally present their work during the workshop.

Accepted papers will be published in ICCV 2023 Workshop proceedings. Submissions must follow [the ICCV 2023 submission format](https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/submission.guidelines-361600-2-20-16.php), including the 8 page limit. Optional supplementary material can be submitted through OpenReview (single .zip file, maximum of 50MB). The deadline for supplementary material is the same as the paper submission deadline.

## Call for posters

Authors of recent and relevant works (including works accepted at the main ICCV 2023 conference paper track) are invited to present a **poster** of their work at our workshop.

Please apply by sending an email to [vipriors-ewi@tudelft.nl](mailto:vipriors-ewi@tudelft.nl) before **September 23rd, 2023**, including your published paper as an attachment. We will judge submissions as they come in, so authors can plan their attendance of the workshop early.
